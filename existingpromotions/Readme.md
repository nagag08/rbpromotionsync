# JFrog Release Bundle Promotion History Sync

This repository contains a Python script designed to perform a bulk synchronization of existing JFrog Artifactory Release Bundle promotion histories from a source JFrog Platform Deployment (JPD) to a target JPD.

This tool is ideal for migration, disaster recovery, or backfilling promotion records to ensure two JFrog instances are in sync.

---

## âœ¨ Features

* **Comprehensive Sync**: Discovers all Release Bundles and all their versions on the source JPD.
* **Idempotent**: Intelligently compares the promotion history of each Release Bundle version against the target and only creates promotions that are missing. It is safe to run multiple times.
* **Detailed Comparison**: A promotion is only considered "missing" if the target does not have a promotion for the same environment with the exact same included and excluded repositories.
* **Environment Filtering**: Optionally allows you to sync promotions for only one specific environment (e.g., only sync `PROD` promotions).
* **Command-Line Driven**: Easy to run manually or from any CI/CD platform.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The script performs a comprehensive, multi-level scan to ensure accuracy:

1.  **Discover Names**: It first queries the source JPD to get a list of all Release Bundle names.
2.  **Discover Versions**: For each name, it fetches all available versions.
3.  **Compare Histories**: For each `name/version` pair, it gets the complete promotion history from both the source and the target JPDs.
4.  **Identify Missing Promotions**: It compares the two histories and builds a list of promotion events that exist on the source but are missing on the target.
5.  **Replicate Promotions**: It iterates through the "missing" list and uses the **JFrog CLI** (`jf rbp`) to execute the promotion on the target JPD, replicating the original state.
6.  **Update Timestamps**: After each successful promotion, it makes an API call to update the timestamp to align with the original promotion time from the source.

## ðŸš€ Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python 3 with the `requests` library installed (`pip install requests`).
* **JFrog CLI** installed on the machine running the script and available in the system's `PATH`.
* Network connectivity from the script's location to both the source and target JPDs.
* Valid access tokens for both JPDs with sufficient permissions (at a minimum: Read on source, Promote Release Bundle on target).
* **Important**: This script only syncs the promotion *metadata*. The underlying artifacts referenced by the Release Bundles **must** already exist on the target JPD for the `jf rbp` command to succeed.

### Execution

The script is run from the command line with five arguments.

#### **Syntax**

```bash
python3 sync_rb_promotions.py <SOURCE_TOKEN> <TARGET_TOKEN> <SOURCE_URL> <TARGET_URL> <ENVIRONMENT_FILTER>
````

#### **Arguments**

| Argument           | Description                                                                                          | Required | Example                    |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `SOURCE_TOKEN`     | An access token for the source JPD.                                                                  | Yes      | `eyJ...`                   |
| `TARGET_TOKEN`     | An access token for the target JPD.                                                                  | Yes      | `eyJ...`                   |
| `SOURCE_URL`       | The full base URL of the source JPD.                                                                 | Yes      | `https://my-source.jfrog.io` |
| `TARGET_URL`       | The full base URL of the target JPD.                                                                 | Yes      | `https://my-target.jfrog.io` |
| `ENVIRONMENT_FILTER` | The specific environment to sync (e.g., "PROD"). To sync all environments, provide empty quotes `""`. | Yes      | `"PROD"` or `""`             |

#### **Examples**

  * **To sync all promotions for all environments:**
    ```bash
    python3 sync_rb_promotions.py <source_token> <target_token> [https://source.jfrog.io](https://source.jfrog.io) [https://target.jfrog.io](https://target.jfrog.io) ""
    ```
  * **To sync ONLY promotions to the `PROD` environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 sync_rb_promotions.py <source_token> <target_token> [https://source.jfrog.io](https://source.jfrog.io) [https://target.jfrog.io](https://target.jfrog.io) "PROD"
    ```
